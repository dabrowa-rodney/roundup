## The system in one breath

Multi-tenant SaaS. Contributors file structured weekly reports → a hybrid
pipeline (code computes the facts, Claude writes the prose) compiles a
leadership **Roundup** → an admin reviews the draft and emails it to
recipients. Everything is **org-scoped**: the current org and role are always
resolved server-side from the signed-in email via `getSessionUser()`
(`src/lib/session.ts`) — **never** from client input. That single rule is the
backbone of tenant isolation.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind v4
- **NextAuth v4** — Google OAuth + a custom magic-link credentials provider
- **Drizzle ORM + Neon Postgres** — every tenant table carries `org_id`
- **Resend** — all transactional email (`notifications.roundup.work`)
- **Stripe** — subscriptions + promotion codes
- **Anthropic API** (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) — AI Roundup generation
- **Vercel** — deploy on push to `master`; two daily crons

## Data model (`src/db/schema.ts`)

```
organisations (tenant: plan, planStatus, stripeCustomerId, trialEndsAt,
               anthropicKeyEnc [AES-256-GCM])
  └─ users (role: admin | contributor | recipient; email globally unique)
  └─ teams (self-referential tree via parentTeamId; ONE root per org —
       │    partial unique index; cadence weekly|monthly|quarterly;
       │    rollupMode members|children|both; templateMode shared|per_member)
       └─ teamMembers (team ↔ user; role 'lead'|'member' is PER TEAM)
  └─ reportTemplates (belongs to a team via teamId; soft-delete: archivedAt;
       │              deletedAt starts 7-day purge)
       └─ questions (type: rag|short_text|long_text|single_choice|
       │             multi_choice|number|file_link; config jsonb)
       └─ reportAssignees (template ↔ user)
       └─ reportInstances (one per template×user×period; weekStart carries
            │               the period's first day; status: not_started|
            │               in_progress|submitted|locked)
            └─ answers (value jsonb, typed by question; unique per instance×question)
  └─ roundups (status: pending|draft|sent; skimJson/fullJson;
       │       ONE PER TEAM PER PERIOD — unique(teamId, periodType,
       │       periodStart); weekStart mirrors periodStart)
       └─ roundupRecipients (per-roundup audience; final once sent)
  └─ settings (schedule + reminder slots; one row per org)
  └─ emailLog (kind × weekStart idempotency ledger; team-scoped kinds
               'roundup_sent:t<id>' for sub-team sends)
loginTokens (magic-link: SHA-256 hash only, 15-min, single-use)
```

**Conventions:** `weekStart`/`periodStart` are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings of the
period's first day — the Monday for weeks, the 1st for calendar months, and
Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct 1st for quarters (`src/lib/dates.ts` owns the math).
Soft-deletes everywhere — historical answers are never hard-deleted so they
remain context for future Roundups. A `deletedAt` template always also has
`archivedAt` set, so `isNull(archivedAt)` queries exclude deleted templates
by construction.

### The team tree & roll-up (docs/DESIGN-nested-teams.md)

Every org is a tree of teams; flat orgs are simply "a one-team tree" (the
root team, created by migration 0007 or on signup — behaviour is unchanged
until sub-teams exist). Reports roll UP the tree:

- A report contributes to **its template's team** (D1); multi-team
  membership governs roles/visibility, not report routing.
- A team's roundup is generated at **its cadence** (weekly/monthly/quarterly,
  calendar-aligned) from inputs chosen by its `rollupMode`: its members'
  reports, its children's roundups + child leads' reports, or both.
  A parent consumes a child's **sent** roundups for the window, falling back
  to the latest draft (D2, `selectChildRows`).
- **Summarise-summaries invariant:** when inputs are child roundups, facts
  (worst-RAG dots, risks, highlights, metric cards) aggregate from the
  children's stored JSON in `compileRoundup` — never re-derived by the
  model. Child charts are not rolled up.
- Tree safety lives in `src/lib/teams.ts`: `wouldCreateCycle`,
  `MAX_TEAM_DEPTH` (8), subtree walks — the DB does not enforce acyclicity.
- Nested teams + non-weekly cadences are **Business-tier** (D5), gated at
  sub-team creation and cadence change.

## Subsystems

### Auth & multi-tenancy — `src/lib/{auth,session,magic-link,org,crypto}.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`
- Two sign-in paths: **Google OAuth** and **passwordless magic links**. A
  magic link stores only the SHA-256 hash of the token; the raw token lives
  only in the emailed URL, expires in 15 minutes, and is single-use (consumed
  atomically).
- `signIn` **never creates a user row.** First-time emails are routed to
  `/onboarding`, which creates an organisation (caller becomes `admin`, gets a
  card-free 14-day Team trial). Invited emails already have a row and simply
  land in their org.
- **`getSessionUser()` (`src/lib/session.ts`) is the one true entry point** for
  "who is calling and what org are they in." Every API route and server
  component resolves `orgId`/`role` through it. Any code that reads an org id
  from the client breaks the security model.
- The session cookie is scoped to `.roundup.work` so it is shared across
  subdomains. `src/proxy.ts` handles host routing (`console.roundup.work` →
  `/console`; wildcard `*.roundup.work` reserved for per-org subdomains).
- Owner console access = `isSuperAdmin(email)` against `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`
  (`src/lib/super-admin.ts`). Console pages **self-gate** — there is no
  `middleware.ts`.
- Org Anthropic keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
  (`src/lib/crypto.ts`, `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`). The key is write-only through the
  API — never returned to the client.

### Weekly lifecycle & crons — `src/lib/{lifecycle,dates}.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/*`, `vercel.json`
- Whether a week is open/locked is **derived** from the org's configured London
  wall-clock schedule at request time — correct even if the cron runs late.
- Two daily Vercel crons:
  - **`lifecycle`** — lock past-close weeks, open the current week for
    assignees (get-or-create instances), purge templates soft-deleted >7 days.
  - **`reminders`** — email contributors who have not yet submitted.
- Both authorize via `Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (acts on all orgs) **or** an admin
  session (own org only). Both set `maxDuration = 60`.

### Email — `src/lib/email.ts` (Resend)
- Table-based "bulletproof" HTML shell (survives Outlook / CSS-stripping
  clients). Kinds: `reminder1`, `reminder2`, `roundup_ready`, `roundup_sent`,
  plus invites and magic links.
- **Never throws**; a missing `RESEND_API_KEY` is a silent no-op.
- Idempotency is enforced by the `emailLog (orgId, kind, weekStart)` unique key
  + `onConflictDoNothing` — however often a cron endpoint is hit, each slot
  fires at most once per week.

### Generation pipeline — `src/lib/{roundup,roundup-ai,sheets}.ts`, `src/app/api/roundups/*`
The core of the product: **code owns the facts, AI writes the prose.**
- **`compileRoundup` (`src/lib/roundup.ts`)** is the deterministic compiler. It
  infers structure from question *type* (rag → RAG dot/severity; number → key
  metric; long_text matching a risk/win regex → risks/highlights) and produces
  the authoritative `SkimJson`/`FullJson` skeleton: metrics, per-team RAG dots,
  report counts, dates, titles.
- **`generateRoundupAI` (`src/lib/roundup-ai.ts`)** overlays AI prose on top of
  that skeleton. It calls `claude-opus-4-8` with adaptive extended thinking and
  schema-constrained output (`output_config.format = json_schema`), a 55s
  client timeout (deliberately under the route's 60s cap), and merges only the
  narrative fields (headline, exec summary, risk/highlight/change phrasing,
  per-team one-liners). **It never throws** — a missing key, a refusal, a
  timeout, or a parse error all fall back to `compileRoundup` output.
- **`src/lib/sheets.ts`** ingests a *public* Google Sheet (only
  `docs.google.com` CSV-export URLs are ever fetched — this is the SSRF guard).
  Column 0 is the period label; each other column is a metric series. Metrics
  need ≥2 non-empty rows; chart series need ≥3 numeric points.
- **Generate → send lifecycle** (`roundups.status`): `pending` → `draft`
  (generate/regenerate, admin-only) → `sent` (send, admin-only, one-shot).
  Generate refuses an empty week (409). Send records recipients, emails
  `recipient`- and `admin`-role users, and marks sent.
- **AI key selection** happens in the generate route, not in `roundup-ai.ts`:
  if the plan includes AI, use the org's decrypted BYO key, else the platform
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; if the plan has no AI entitlement, no key (deterministic).

### Plans & billing — `src/lib/{plans,org-plan,stripe}.ts`, `src/app/api/billing/*`, `src/app/api/stripe/webhook`
- Tiers: **free** (3 members / 1 template / no AI), **team** (25 / ∞ / AI),
  **business** (∞), **complimentary** (owner-granted, business-equivalent, no
  subscription).
- Limits are enforced at three chokepoints: **member invite**, **template
  create**, **AI generate**.
- The 14-day trial is purely time-based via `trialEndsAt` (no scheduled job).
- Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal + a signature-verified webhook keep
  `organisations.plan` / `planStatus` in sync. Discount codes are Stripe
  promotion codes, managed from the console. Prices are multi-currency
  (GBP default, USD auto-applied) on shared lookup keys. `scripts/stripe-setup.mjs`
  idempotently bootstraps products/prices/webhook.
- Every billing route 503s gracefully when Stripe env is unset.

### App & console — `src/app/(app)/*`, `src/app/console/*`, `src/components/*`
- The authenticated shell (`src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`) redirects no-session →
  `/login`, session-but-no-row → `/onboarding`, then splits by role: **admins**
  get the full `Sidebar`; **contributors/recipients** get the slim `Topbar`.
- Role home routing: recipients → `/roundups`, everyone else → `/my-reports`
  (mirrored in `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/components/topbar.tsx`).
- List/read pages are **server components** querying Drizzle directly; mutation
  screens (reports manager, team, settings, data sources, console detail) are
  **client components** that `fetch` and then `router.refresh()` or re-fetch.
- The report form autosaves with an 800ms debounce (`src/components/report-form.tsx`),
  disabled once the week locks. A "Nothing this week" skip uses a sentinel value
  and is excluded from Roundup generation.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **Org/role always come from `getSessionUser()`**, never from client input.
   Team ids from the client are always re-validated against the caller's org.
2. **The AI never supplies numbers, RAG dots, or chart data** — only prose.
   Chart points are copied verbatim from sheet series; unknown chart labels are
   dropped. This extends to roll-ups: parent facts aggregate from child
   roundup JSON in code. (Enforced by `roundup-ai.test.ts` / `roundup.test.ts`.)
3. **The AI path must stay total-fallback** — `generateRoundupAI` never throws,
   and the 55s client timeout must stay strictly under the 60s route cap. A
   broken AI path degrades silently to deterministic output, so verify the SDK
   request/response shape after any `@anthropic-ai/sdk` or model change.
4. **Email and instance idempotency rely on unique keys + `onConflictDoNothing`**,
   not application locks.
5. **This is a modified Next.js.** `params` is a `Promise` (await it); there is
   no `middleware.ts`; read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before changing
   routes or pages.
6. **Untrusted free-text** (contributor answers, sheet cells) is interpolated
   into the AI prompt. Injection can at worst distort prose — facts, dots, and
   chart data are code/sheet-sourced and schema-constrained — but treat
   generated prose as attacker-influenceable.

## Environment variables

See `README.md` for the full table. Every integration degrades gracefully when
its key is missing: no email key → silent no-op; no AI key → deterministic
Roundups; no Stripe → billing shows "coming soon".

## Working on the codebase

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm test         # Vitest (85+ unit tests: dates/tz, lifecycle, compiler,
                 #         AI merge rules, crypto, plans, email, sheets)
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit # typecheck
npm run db:generate | db:push | db:studio   # drizzle-kit
```

Tests are the fast feedback loop and cover the tricky logic (date/tz math,
lifecycle transitions, the compiler, AI merge rules, sheet parsing). Run them
before and after any change to `src/lib/*`.
